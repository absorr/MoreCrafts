It had enough new stuff, and it did not cause any (known) problems. Development builds are experimental, sometimes not even tested (which is usally why it is posted, because I want you to). If the development build has a .txt file in it with instructions on what to report back with, make sure to do exactly that. You can subit your dev reports to the Issues section of this repository, or by commenting on the commit where it was released.## Planned Features**MoreCrafts v2.0.00*** Advanced Spawn Eggs* Disassembly Bench* Craftable EnchantmentsAND MORE!
